Code implementation

A large part of how I use models, views came from the official docs, as well as most of my overall understanding of the framework.

I implemented  the wrapper classes to keep the currency, country and csv logic  away from the views and models. 

Possible Improvements

 - Verbose error handling needs to be added

 - Remove model creation from csv 

 - Improve serializer implemenation

 - Add safety checks for db and redis

 - Lining using flake8 or pylint and commenting

 - Unit tests need to added as well
